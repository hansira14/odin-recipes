    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My grandmother's hamburger casserole is classic comfort food! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates back to the 1940's. You can tweak the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what you've got in the fridge â€” it'll still turn out great!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 package egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the sour cream mixture, then 1/2 of the ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
